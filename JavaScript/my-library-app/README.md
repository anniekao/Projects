# Introduction
my-library-app was created as part of the curriculum for The Odin Project. So far, there have been two phases in developing
this project:

### 1) Creating the Book constructor
* The book object should have the bookâ€™s title, author, the number of pages, and whether or not you have read the book
* The constructor should also contain a function that reports book info, e.g. book.info() return "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, 295 pages, not read yet"

### 2) Expanding it into an app
- [x] Set up the HTML/CSS skeleton
- [x] Add a function to the script that takes a user's input and stores the new book objects into an array
- [x] Connect the HTML file to a render() function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page, e.g. by means of a table or by displaying it as its own 'card
- [x] Add a 'new book' button that brings up a form that allows the the user to input details for a new book, e.g. 'Title', 'Author', 'Pages', 'Read/Unread' etc.
- [x] Add a button on each book's display to remove that book from the library
- [x] Add a button to change a book's read status
- [x] Optional: Save the data using either localStorage or Firebase

# What I learned/practiced...
* First experience with Firebase and databases in general -- writing to, reading from, and updating the db with JS
* Reading in information from a form, creating an object instance from it, and then storing it in an array
* Reading from an array and displaying the information from each object instance in a table as well as updating the array and table as needed
* Improving CSS -- first by trying to cobble together a layout using basic CSS and then bringing in Bootstrap to make the interface more streamlined
